A few of my work projects from my first year of Computer Science College at University Politehnica of Bucharest.

Most of them are based on replicating some of Linux CLI commands such as grep, cut, sort using a given input.

Also I have created a file system similar to the one in Linux that allows the user to create folders, files, inspect the files using 'cat'
and all the other basic commands for a file system such as: ls, cd, pwd etc.
